# TipTap Figures Extension

![demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/usmansher/tiptap-extension-figure/refs/heads/main/demo.gif?raw=true)

## üöÄ Enhanced Fork Features

This is a fork of the original TipTap Image Extension with bug fixes and new features:

### Key Improvements:

1. **üóëÔ∏è Delete Image Button**: Added a red delete button for one-click image removal
   - Positioned in the top-right corner of images
   - Safe deletion using TipTap's transaction system

2. **üêõ Bug Fix**: Fixed issue where controls stopped working after caption removal
   - Previously, removing a caption would break all image controls (resize, alignment, etc.)
   - Now controls remain fully functional for both captioned and non-captioned images

See the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for detailed information about all improvements.
