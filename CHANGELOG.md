> **Note**: This is a fork of the original TipTap Image Extension with critical bug fixes and new features.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-06-18

### Added
- **üóëÔ∏è Delete Image Button**: Added a red delete button in the top-right corner of images
  - Allows users to completely remove images from the editor with one click
  - Uses proper TipTap transaction system for safe deletion
  - Visual feedback with red styling to indicate destructive action

### Fixed
- **üêõ Critical Bug**: Fixed major issue where image controls (resize, alignment, caption) stopped working after removing a caption
  - Previously, after removing a caption from a figure, the image would lose all interactive controls
  - Now controls remain fully functional for both `<img>` and `<figure>` elements
  - Ensures seamless user experience when toggling between captioned and non-captioned images

### Changed
- **Control Architecture**: Refactored control system to work uniformly across image types
  - Unified event handling for `<div>` (images) and `<figure>` (captioned images)
  - Consistent control positioning and behavior
- **Transaction Safety**: Improved all content modifications to use TipTap's transaction system
  - Eliminates direct DOM manipulation that could break editor state
  - Ensures proper undo/redo functionality

### Technical Details
- Refactored control system to work uniformly across `<img>` and `<figure>` elements
- Improved TipTap transaction handling for better editor state management
- Enhanced event handling and click propagation control
